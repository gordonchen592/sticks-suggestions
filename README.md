# Sticks Suggestions
Final Project by Team CCL for ME369P: Application Programming for Engineers.

# Overview
stick-suggestions is a python program that provides the optimal next move for a game of [chopsticks (AKA sticks or calculator)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chopsticks_(hand_game)) in real time. It uses OpenCV and MediaPipe to detect the currect game position based on camera input.

# Prerequisites
The following packages should be installed before running the program:
* OpenCV: `opencv-python`
* MediaPipe: `mediapipe`
* NumPy: `numpy`

You can do so by pip installing the requirements.txt file:
```python
pip install requirements.txt
```

A working camera should also be available for the script to use. The camera should be oriented such that both players' hands are in frame and the background should have an appropriate amount of contrast with both players' hands.
